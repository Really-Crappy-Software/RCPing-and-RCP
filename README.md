# RCPing-and-RCP
# Really Crappy Ping and Protocol
* SYNTAX rcping port address
* PS: This requires libcap, but since I am sooo kind the script installs it for you
* PPS: This uses RCP as it's main protocol, RCP is also why it took so long
* PPPS: You need to use sudo for this otherwise the socket wont be created due to libcap caps.
* The protocol is a proof of concept and will be more complex in the future
